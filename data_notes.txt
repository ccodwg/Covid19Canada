New data: 2022-02-15. See data notes.

DATA NOTES:

- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to recent changes in the availability of COVID-19 testing, case counts can no longer be considered a reliable indicator of spread.
- BC testing is from the daily values reported on the BCCDC dashboard rather than the cumulative value reported in the lab CSV, as the lab CSV was not updated today.
- Recovered decline in MB today for an unknown reason.
- SK data reporting will continue in the near future when we determine how to integrate the newly reported data format.
- As of 2021-02-10, recovered & active case values should be discarded, as BC has stopped reporting these metrics.
- See notice in “RECENT CHANGES” section below regarding NS cases since 2021-12-10.
- See notice in “RECENT CHANGES” section below regarding PE cases since 2021-11-02.

NEWS RELEVANT TO COVID-19 DATA:

Beginning 2022-02-07, Saskatchewan will only be reporting a limited set of data once per week on Thursdays. See the following for more details: https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2022/february/03/living-with-covid-transition-of-public-health-management

RECENT CHANGES TO THE DATASET:

SK total doses number has been fixed retroactively to include third doses. Previously it included only first and second doses, unlike other provinces. Additionally, added historical NU third doses reported in the vaccine coverage file provided by PHAC (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage).

BC recovered: As of 2021-02-10, BC will no longer report the number of active or recovered cases. “February 10, 2022: Active Cases have been removed from the dashboard as the values no longer reflect active community transmission numbers.”

PE recovered: From now on, recovered values will be calculated as total cases - active cases - deaths, based primarily on the data provided in the daily press releases. This value has been recalculated back to the date of the first reported deaths in PEI (2022-01-14). [UPDATE, 2022-01-31: As of today, it appears that PEI is now appropriately accounting for deaths in the recovered value posted to their dashboard.]

NS is again reporting the number of doses administered (1st, 2nd, 3rd) on their dashboard, which will be used going forward.

Some ON Public Health Unit (PHU) datasets have been retired and replaced with the Ontario Ministry of Health dataset, rewriting their cases, mortality and recovered datasets back to 2020-04-01. You can track this here: https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada/issues/97

NU cumulative testing number has been replaced by the time series of tests completed from the Public Health Agency of Canada (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html). The reason for this is that the previously reported value, number of people tested, somehow decreased by ~80% and has not been corrected for several days.

Since 2021-11-02, cases and recovered for PE have been based on the number of cases reported by PHAC on weekdays (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html) and the daily press releases on weekends (https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news), as the PHAC dataset is not updated over the weekend. This change is due to the very inconsistent updating of the usual data source, the PEI dashboard (https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/health-and-wellness/covid-19-testing-and-case-data). The data reported by PHAC seems to match the data reported in press releases. [Note that historical values for 2021-11-02 to 2021-12-20 were re-calculated on 2021-12-20. 2021-11-02 was selected because it was not too far back and there was agreement in the number of cumulative cases reported by PHAC and the province on this day (319).] [GitHub issue #89]

Additional doses (booster doses, 3rd doses, 4th doses) doses are now being reported for most provinces in a new dataset: vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_prov / vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_canada.csv

First doses may be calculated as: total doses administered – vaccine completion (2nd doses) – additional doses.
