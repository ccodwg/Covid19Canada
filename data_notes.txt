New data: 2022-01-27. See data notes.

DATA NOTES:

- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to recent changes in the availability of COVID-19 testing, case counts can no longer be considered a reliable indicator of spread.
- Halton (ON) is no longer reporting probable and confirmed cases but rather only total cases. Previously, probable cases were removed from the total cases and recovered value.
- It appears NL has removed 3rd doses from their total vaccinated number. This has been ignored by our dataset. New first and second doses will continue to be added to the total doses total, while the additional doses total will be frozen at its last value. [UPDATE 2022-01-27: NL has once again re-added 3rd doses]
- See notice in “RECENT CHANGES” section below regarding NS cases since 2021-12-10.
- See notice in “RECENT CHANGES” section below regarding PE cases since 2021-11-02.

RECENT CHANGES TO THE DATASET:

NL has removed 3rd doses from their total vaccinated number. This has been ignored by our dataset. New first and second doses will continue to be added to the total doses total, while the additional doses total will be frozen at its last value. An inquiry will be made to NL regarding this change. [UPDATE 2022-01-27: NL has once again re-added 3rd doses]

BC recovered: BC has removed information on recovered cases, thus this will now be calculated as total cases - active cases - deaths.

PE recovered: From now on, recovered values will be calculated as total cases - active cases - deaths, based primarily on the data provided in the daily press releases. This value has been recalculated back to the date of the first reported deaths in PEI (2022-01-14).

NS is again reporting the number of doses administered (1st, 2nd, 3rd) on their dashboard, which will be used going forward.

Chatham-Kent (ON) was rewritten (cases, deaths, recovered) back to 2020-04-01 using the Ontario Ministry of Health dataset (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario-by-public-health-unit-phu/resource/d1bfe1ad-6575-4352-8302-09ca81f7ddfc). Previously we used the PHU’s dashboard, as we do for all other PHUs (https://ckphu.com/current-situation-in-chatham-kent/). However, there are significant discrepancies in cases, deaths and recovered between these two data sources, which made rewriting the whole time series the least disruptive option to the trends in the data. The same process has now been done with Leeds, Grenville & Lanark, Eastern and Huron Perth (for the same reason).

NU cumulative testing number has been replaced by the time series of tests completed from the Public Health Agency of Canada (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html). The reason for this is that the previously reported value, number of people tested, somehow decreased by ~80% and has not been corrected for several days.

Since 2021-11-02, cases and recovered for PE have been based on the number of cases reported by PHAC on weekdays (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html) and the daily press releases on weekends (https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news), as the PHAC dataset is not updated over the weekend. This change is due to the very inconsistent updating of the usual data source, the PEI dashboard (https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/health-and-wellness/covid-19-testing-and-case-data). The data reported by PHAC seems to match the data reported in press releases. [Note that historical values for 2021-11-02 to 2021-12-20 were re-calculated on 2021-12-20. 2021-11-02 was selected because it was not too far back and there was agreement in the number of cumulative cases reported by PHAC and the province on this day (319).] [GitHub issue #89]

Additional doses (booster doses, 3rd doses, 4th doses) doses are now being reported for most provinces in a new dataset: vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_prov / vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_canada.csv

First doses may be calculated as: total doses administered – vaccine completion (2nd doses) – additional doses.

README on GitHub has been updated to provide a better description of the dataset: https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada

ON DATA NOTE: As of 2021-09-07, active cases for ON should be correctly reported. Note that this has resulted in a major discontinuity for recovered and active cases for ON on 2021-09-07. Our case and mortality data from ON have been sourced from individual PHU websites (rather than the provincial MOH dataset) since April 1, 2020. However, the "recovered" number continued to be sourced from the MOH. As the PHU and MOH datasets diverged (several thousand cases were never confirmed and thus not included in the MOH datasets), this resulted in an inflated active case count for the province (daily differences were more or less reliable). On 2021-09-07, we transitioned to using recovered numbers directly from the PHUs; thus, active cases should now be correctly reported for ON. Additionally, 13 cases were added to Haliburton Kawartha Pineridge (ON) on 2021-09-07 to maintain consistency with the corrected recovery calculation. We regret the inconvenience.

DATA NOTE FOR SK: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates. A REPLACEMENT DATASET IS IMMINENT.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon as it becomes possible to do so.
