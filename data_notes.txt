Summarized by May Warren (https://twitter.com/maywarren11/status/1476649614879203330):


- Only high risk ppl/ppl in high risk settings will qualify for publicly funded PCR tests
- Otherwise, if you have symptoms and are fully vaccinated, assume you have it and isolate for 5 days


RECENT CHANGES TO THE DATASET:

Since 2021-12-10, cases and deaths for NS have been based on the number of cases reported in the daily press releases (https://novascotia.ca/news/search/?dept=180) rather than the usual dashboard numbers (https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/204d6ed723244dfbb763ca3f913c5cad). Quoting the press release from 2021-12-10 (https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20211210011): “Because of the outbreak at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, beginning today, the number of positive cases using lab results, not Panorama results, will be reported to better reflect the situation on the ground. The results will continue to be reported by zone.” We will pull these numbers from the daily press releases (these numbers are also reported on the dashboard, but the dashboard is not updated on weekends). [Note that historical values for 2021-12-10 to 2021-12-17 were re-calculated on 2021-12-18.] Note that recovered/active case numbers are inaccurate between 2021-12-10 to 2021-12-22, as they did not start reporting accurate active case numbers in the press releases until 2021-12-23. [GitHub issue #89]


Since 2021-11-02, cases and recovered for PE have been based on the number of cases reported by PHAC on weekdays (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html) and the daily press releases on weekends (https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news), as the PHAC dataset is not updated over the weekend. This change is due to the very inconsistent updating of the usual data source, the PEI dashboard (https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/health-and-wellness/covid-19-testing-and-case-data). The data reported by PHAC seems to match the data reported in press releases. [Note that historical values for 2021-11-02 to 2021-12-20 were re-calculated on 2021-12-20. 2021-11-02 was selected because it was not too far back and there was agreement in the number of cumulative cases reported by PHAC and the province on this day (319).] [GitHub issue #89]




MB vaccine total doses and vaccine completions time series were rewritten on 2021-12-17 using the time series on the MB vaccination page (https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html). We shifted the time series one day forward (because the value for 2021-12-16 is reported on 2021-12-17). Values of the total doses time series prior to 2020-12-16 were dropped, as this is the first day vaccines were administered in MB. Values of vaccine completions prior to 2021-01-13 were dropped, as this is the first day this value was originally reported by MB. The reason for rewriting this time series is that the total doses and vaccine completion datasets were slightly different; with this time series, these two values come from the same source, along with the new vaccine additional doses time series. With this new data source, we will prioritize matching today’s cumulative total for each value, as usual. This will occasionally result in strange values (e.g., more new third doses than total doses). This is because MB makes extensive modifications to the historical values in their time series. However, we cannot account for these unless we rewrite the entire vaccination time series every day.


As of 2021-12-06, the NWT sub-health region active cases dataset (official_datasets/nt/nt_active_timeseries_subhr.csv) no longer delineates between active cases in residents and non-residents, instead giving only the total number of active cases.

Additional doses (booster doses, 3rd doses, 4th doses) doses are now being reported for some provinces in a new dataset: vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_prov / vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_canada.csv

First doses may be calculated as: total doses administered – vaccine completion (2nd doses) – additional doses.

README on GitHub has been updated to provide a better description of the dataset: https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada

ON DATA NOTE: As of 2021-09-07, active cases for ON should be correctly reported. Note that this has resulted in a major discontinuity for recovered and active cases for ON on 2021-09-07. Our case and mortality data from ON have been sourced from individual PHU websites (rather than the provincial MOH dataset) since April 1, 2020. However, the "recovered" number continued to be sourced from the MOH. As the PHU and MOH datasets diverged (several thousand cases were never confirmed and thus not included in the MOH datasets), this resulted in an inflated active case count for the province (daily differences were more or less reliable). On 2021-09-07, we transitioned to using recovered numbers directly from the PHUs; thus, active cases should now be correctly reported for ON. Additionally, 13 cases were added to Haliburton Kawartha Pineridge (ON) on 2021-09-07 to maintain consistency with the corrected recovery calculation. We regret the inconvenience.

QC DATA NOTE: QC vaccination numbers are now from: https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/covid-19-portrait-quotidien-de-la-vaccination/resource/3895305f-0c29-47a4-a0d1-b19f2e6c94bd

These vary slightly from other sources but are more consistent.

DATA NOTE FOR SK: As of 2020-12-14, we are providing a daily version of the official SK dataset that is compatible with the rest of our dataset in the folder official_datasets/sk. See below for information about our regular updates. A REPLACEMENT DATASET IS IMMINENT.

SK transitioned to reporting according to a new, expanded set of health regions on 2020-09-14. Unfortunately, the new health regions do not correspond exactly to the old health regions. Additionally, the provided case time series using the new boundaries do not exist for dates earlier than August 4, making providing a time series using the new boundaries impossible.

For now, we are adding new cases according to the list of new cases given in the “highlights” section of the SK government website (https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/cases). These new cases are roughly grouped according to the old boundaries. However, health region totals were redistributed when the new boundaries were instituted on 2020-09-14, so while our daily case numbers match the numbers given in this section, our cumulative totals do not. We have reached out to the SK government to determine how this issue can be resolved. We will rectify our SK health region time series as soon as it becomes possible to do so.
