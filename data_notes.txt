DATA NOTES:

- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Before using our data, please read the updated “Data notes and caveats” section of the README: https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada#datasets
- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to recent changes in the availability of COVID-19 testing, case counts can no longer be considered a reliable indicator of spread.
- REPORTING OF RECOVERED/ACTIVE CASES: As of 2021-02-10, recovered & active case values should be discarded, as several provinces (BC, NS, SK) have stopped reporting these metrics.
- Note that NT includes Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) and Point of Care Tests (POCT) in their case numbers. However, they have ceased to report PCR testing numbers. This will be dealt with in the coming days.
- New case and recovered numbers for NL at the health region-level appear to be inaccurate (not shown on dashboard, but available via JSON query). Thus, recovered will be retired and cases will be reported at the province level only (i.e., all new cases will have not reported health regions). Added new cases from province-level total going back to 2022-03-12 (the day after the last HR-level case report). Death reporting appears unaffected.
- AB is no longer reporting recovered/active case values.
- NL appears to no longer be reporting third dose values or testing numbers. These values will be dealt with or retired in the coming days.
- NS appears to no longer be reporting testing values. This will be dealt with in the coming days.
- NS appears to no longer be reporting all vaccine values. This will be dealt with in the coming days.
- See notice in “RECENT CHANGES” section below regarding NS cases since 2021-12-10.
- See notice in “RECENT CHANGES” section below regarding PE cases since 2021-11-02.

RECENT CHANGES TO THE DATASET:

Beginning 2022-02-07, Saskatchewan will only be reporting a limited set of data once per week on Thursdays. See the news release for more details (https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2022/february/03/living-with-covid-transition-of-public-health-management). Metrics will be updated as best as possible using weekly values reported in the weekly epi report. The Thursday reports report data up to the previous Sunday (actually, Saturday, but these data would have been reported on Sunday under the previous reporting model).

The value for total doses and additional doses (3rd doses) is likely inflated since 2022-02-13 since 4th doses are no longer being excluded from the total doses and additional doses count, as they were prior to this date. Formulas used: total_administration = previous value + “total”; vaccine_completion = previous total + “second dose of two” + “Janssen single dose”; additional_doses = previous total + “first and second boosters after complete series”. Weekly values are used rather than cumulative values due to inconsistencies reported between cumulative values in this report and cumulative values previously reported on the dashboard.

Some ON Public Health Unit (PHU) datasets have been retired and replaced with the Ontario Ministry of Health dataset, rewriting their cases, mortality and recovered datasets back to 2020-04-01. You can track this here: https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada/issues/97

Additional doses (booster doses, 3rd doses, 4th doses) doses are now being reported for most provinces in a new dataset: vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_prov / vaccine_additionaldoses_timeseries_canada.csv

First doses may be calculated as: total doses administered – vaccine completion (2nd doses) – additional doses.
