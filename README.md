# Epidemiological Data from the COVID-19 Outbreak in Canada
We are collecting publicly available information on confirmed and presumptive postive cases during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Canada. Data are entered in a spreadsheet with each line representing a unique case, including age, sex, health region location, and history of travel where available. Sources are included as a reference for each entry. All data are exclusively collected from publicly available sources including government reports and news media.


# Acknowledgements
We want to thank all individuals and organizations across Canada who have been willing and able to report data in as open and timely a manner as possible.
